My first publication is more "why" this blog and going directly to the point is to share experience and knowledge in this fast change tech world. A lot of people who I've been following always said the same thing shared knowledge, write about your experience and the environment that you experienced and which tecnologies are you using today and now I'm starting my own jorney here.


This is not my first blog, I really like to write, my first blog still on-line and was about shows and rock bands in my home town, because of my lack of time I ended for leaving but if you wanna take a look [rock-ce](http://ce-rock.blogspot.com/). 

Agora na pegada mais tecnologica eu já vinha tentando fazer isso na por meuio da minha conta do [github](https://github.com/krismorte) lá vocês podem conferir que em alguns repositórios eu me esforcei pra escrever um bom README, mas por aqui consigo fazer isso multi linguagem, também cogitei  usar a plataforma do [Medium](https://medium.com/@krisnamourt.filho) mas lá não há suporte a multi linguagem também, então ou teria que criar 2 contas ou publicar 2 vezes o mesmo conteúdo o que não me parece legal. Aqui terei liberdade de escrever em inglês e em português e num futuro quem sabe em espanhol. Falta muito material em portugês e pra quem ta começando dificulta bastante, mas isso não é pra fazer vocês desistir do inglês estudem!.

Now in the more tech path I'v been trying to do that in my [github](https://github.com/krismorte) account there you can see some repositories when I tried hard to write some good README files, but here I can do the same and with multi language support, I thought maybe [Medium](https://medium.com/@krisnamourt.filho) plataform , but the same problem about muilti language too I would have two account or publish the 
same article twice and it's not nice. Here I will have the liberty to write in Portuguese and Englisn, maybe Spanish in the future. There's a lack of Portuguese material and it's hard if you at the beginnig, but it's not a excuse to not learn the lanaguage.

I hope you enjoy it, I'm still learning about [Hugo] (https://gohugo.io/) and [Githu Pages] (https://pages.github.com/) this is the techonolies under the hook, in the future somethings maybe change here or not. And about the content you will see things like  Java, SQL, GO, Terraform and go on.
