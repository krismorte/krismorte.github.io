Hi, I'm Krisnamourt but you can call me Kris. Fortalezence, married, pet family, musician by vocation and passionate about innovation. Born in [Fortaleza-CE](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortaleza), I lived [Ribeirão Preto-SP](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribeir%C3%A3o_Preto) too and currently living in [Limeira-SP](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limeira). Since 2008 I've been working as DBA, but I am graduaded in systems analysis and development by [FIC](https://portal.estacio.br/unidades/centro-universitário-estácio-do-ceará/) I always have been betweent theses tow worlds infrastructure and development, today with the birth and maturation fo DEVOPS I believe I found myself in this industry. The truth I really like to develop solutions, solving problems and doesn't matter what I have to learn to do it. 

No man live just for work. I love traveling and living in a continental country there is always some interesting place to visit. I love to read, despite the late habit, philosophy, economics, history we always have something to learn philosophy is an end in itself, economics, I don't know, at some point I liked the topic to the point of studying for pure pleasure. If it can get my attention, intrigues me, I will probably try to read. My first profession was musician, I spent 5 years of my youth playing percussion and bass and even today I bring that passion with me whenever I can join a weekend band to play I will shake some walls playing Thrash Metal.

I could extend it more here, but the idea of ​​the blog is to talk more about technologies and projects that I have been involved with, I believe that at some point I may be helping someone through my experiences. I do not know if I will also publish personal opinions on other topics, the blog will be an experiment and in the course of it may undergo transformations. I don't risk predicting the future.

Anyone who wants to discuss an idea on the side menu has links to my social networks, see you around.
