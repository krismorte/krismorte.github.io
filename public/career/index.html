<p><em>MAR DE 2019 ~ , Ribeirão Preto-SP</em></p>
<p>Database Administrator on the Solutions Engineering Team
Manage aurora mysql and postgresql and mssql always-on cluster in EC2 instances at the AWS environment. My activities range from access control to data migration between analyzing instances and improving queries. Create alert and performance frames in datadog. All this administration is made using terraform.
As a member of the engineer team I always been involved in some project like automatizate database documentation through a docker image + java app using schemaspy free library. I also developed the CI\CD of our procedures in our legacy database and I actually working in some solutions using lambda to automate the duplication of our RDS snapshots and some monitoring in the databases too.
In addition to these described activities I also help on other internal systems using Java, GO and Nodejs.</p>
<h2 id="camedhttpswwwcamedcombrportalcamed--dba-sr"><a href="https://www.camed.com.br/PortalCamed/">CAMED</a> — DBA Sr</h2>
<p><em>ABR 2014 - MAR 2019, Fortaleza-CE</em></p>
<p>First of all you will see a conflicting period with Banco do Nordeste but isn`t a mistake, I really worked in both companies because Camed was halp time.
Camed is a type of holding, because the main activities was keep the healtcare system but ended to absorve the insurance busines <a href="http://www.camedseguros.com.br/">Camed Corretora</a> too an even kindergarten keept to the BNB staff and the employees themselves <a href="https://www.camed.com.br/PortalCamed/tag/creche-paulo-vi/">Creche Paulo VI</a>.
At Camed I was the Senior DBA for the all three companies manager at least 15 mssql server and some mysql and postgres, our mains systems were <a href="https://www4.benner.com.br/solucoes-para-reducao-de-custos/terceirizacao-de-servicos/area-da-saude">Benner Saúde</a> and the ERP from Totvs <a href="https://www.totvs.com/blog/rm-totvs/">RM</a> and <a href="https://www.totvs.com/sistema-de-gestao/?utm_campaign=totvs_conversao_sql&amp;utm_source=ppc&amp;utm_medium=google_search&amp;utm_content=ad_text_linha_produto_protheus_v2&amp;utm_term=totvs%20protheus&amp;hsa_tgt=kwd-22906999271&amp;hsa_src=g&amp;hsa_acc=5745705588&amp;hsa_cam=1596798386&amp;hsa_grp=61487630398&amp;hsa_mt=e&amp;hsa_kw=totvs%20protheus&amp;hsa_net=adwords&amp;hsa_ver=3&amp;hsa_ad=323306954110&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIw46EmoLZ5gIVhYORCh0ovgdDEAAYASAAEgKZSPD_BwE">Protheus</a>. The other systems were from in-house development to support our operation. My activities here were backup/restore, query tunning, data and server migration and version upgrade, we also had a replication envirioment. I also act as a Java developer and had my first experience with .net technologie help to developer a integration service between heathcare systems through XML files TUSS and TISS.</p>
<h2 id="banco-do-nordeste-bnbhttpswwwbnbgovbr--dba-sr"><a href="https://www.bnb.gov.br/">Banco do Nordeste BNB</a> — DBA Sr</h2>
<p><em>JUL 2009 - MAR 2018, Fortaleza-CE</em></p>
<p>Banco do Nordeste is a public bank of fomentation in the northwest of the contry focuses on micro credit and very active in the nine states with more than 300 agencies. In this company I was allocated by three different companies in this order <a href="https://stefanini.com/en-us">Stefanini</a>, 2009-2014, [Capgemini](<a href="https://www.capgemini.com/en-">https://www.capgemini.com/en-</a> pt /). 2014-2016 and <a href="https://www.sonda.com/en-us/">SondaIT</a>, 2016-2018. Independent of the company I always worked as a DBA MSSQL in the same team
which had up to 12 members in a 24x7 operation with shifts for weekends and holidays.
I usually get to say that if you worked as a DBA in the BNB you fit in anywhere, managing server from 7.5 until 2016 version, stand alone or cluster arrived until nodes, transactional replication involved more than 300 server, tables with 5 billion rows, data migration, servers migration and upgrates, query tuning, SQL development (queries, procedures, trigger), table partitioning, backup and restore and more. At the last we admintrate above 500 sql server between production, approval and testing. Maintenance, backups and restores automation plus several partitioning automation scripts, audit were developed beyond the time-consuming replication of our administration. A very challenging environment and I believe still to be so. Here I also used my programmer skills and whenever possible I created a solution in Java to automate some steps of our daily life as even a system overtime control that was adopted by the contract company</p>
<h2 id="lanlink-informática-ltdahttpswwwlanlinkcombr--trainee"><a href="https://www.lanlink.com.br/">Lanlink Informática Ltda</a> — Trainee</h2>
<p><em>JUN 2008 - JUL 2009, Fortaleza-CE</em></p>
<p>As a trainee we were involved in a internal project to training SQL Server DBA and take on  a project. Our activities was take classes to obtain a MCITP certification and follow our senior DBA in projects and daily tasks. Our mentor was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabiohemylio/">Fábio Hemilio</a>.</p>
<h2 id="projects-as-a-freelancer">Projects as a Freelancer</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>I always worked as a DBA and the systems I developed were always personal projects or some automation. As a freelancer I could managed to experience a development project in addition to acting in other roles within technology. Follow my profiles on the platforms I work on <a href="https://www.workana.com/freelancer/9d22f6aafaf0432e235e6dc48e5f611f">Workana</a> and <a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~011b93ab5cbbf7bdca?viewMode=1">UpWork</a></p>

<h2 id="myp-7httpsmyp7combr--java-dev"><a href="https://myp7.com.br/">MYP-7</a> — Java Dev</h2>
<p>In this project I was hired as a remote java developer to working in two projects to the same client that is a big selle in the north of the country. The projects was a workflow to manager the high quantite of products, supplier and seller to register in the sysmte and after integrate in the ERP and the other was a WMS to manager the warehouse of the products from the arrived, location and send to the shop.</p>
<h2 id="fixpayhttpsfixpaycombr--java-dev--devops"><a href="https://fixpay.com.br/">FIXPAY</a> — Java Dev &amp; Devops</h2>
<p>Here through a friend&rsquo;s indication I was hired from a new payment company as a remote Java developer. At the begining I had to developer digital contract signature and after evolve to a ticket manager for internal and external calls too. All systems build on-premise, after these projects was started a new project arise to consume EDI Files from acquirers <a href="https://www.adiq.com.br/">Adiq</a> and <a href="https://www.userede.com.br/quero-rede?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIh9aJxIbZ5gIVEoWRCh0RRQZrEAAYASAAEgJx3_D_BwE&amp;s_cid=mpg%7Cgog%7Cglp%7Cvt-rede-aquisicao-marca-responsivo-taxa-vendas%7Ccnr%7C6%7Csec%7CCRM0000%7C-%7Cvt&amp;ef_id=EAIaIQobChMIh9aJxIbZ5gIVEoWRCh0RRQZrEAAYASAAEgJx3_D_BwE:G:s&amp;s_kwcid=AL!673!3!372703000018!e!!g!!rede">Rede</a> to check the payment data. With the system growth was suggested and taken the ideia to migrate all the systems to the AWS cloud with the  EC2, S3, RDS and finally a jenkins implementation to the system pipeline development.</p>
